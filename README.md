# Record Cleaner Rules
This repository is for the rules used by the NBN Record Cleaner automated species verification tool.

You can read about and download the [NBN Record Cleaner](https://nbn.org.uk/tools-and-resources/nbn-toolbox/nbn-record-cleaner/).

For human convenience, rule data is supplied in CSV files which can be easily created from a spreadsheet. Scripts then convert these in to the [rule file format](https://data.nbn.org.uk/recordcleaner/documentation/NBNRecordCleanerRuleGuide.pdf)
